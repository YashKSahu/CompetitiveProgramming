# Backtracking
- ***synonyms*** - turn-back, retrogress
- Here, we attempt solving a subproblem, and if we don't reach the desired solution, then undo whatever we did for solving that subproblem, and try solving another subproblem. - **hackerearth**
- A *backtracking* algorithm tries to construct a solution to a computational problem incrementally, one small piece at a time. Whenever the algorithm needs to decide between multiple alternatives to the next component of the solution, it recursively evaluates every alternative and then chooses the best one. - **Chapter 2 - Backtracking, Algorithms by Jeff Erickson**
- *Backtracking* is a class of algorithm for finding solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution. - **wikipedia**
- A *backtracking* algorithm begins with an empty solution and extends the solution step by step. The search recursively goes through all different ways how a solution can be constructed. - **Guide to Competitive Programming by Antti Laaksonen**

## History
- The prototypical backtracking problem is the classical n Queens Problem, first proposed by German chess enthusiast Max Bezzel in 1848 (under his pseudonym “Schachfreund”) for the standard 8x8 board and by François-Joseph Eustache Lionnet in 1869 for the more general $N$ x $N$ board.
